    "**Introduction:**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects the body's ability to turn food into energy. Normally after consumption, glucose is released into the bloodstream causing the pancreas to release insulin. This provides a signal so that our cells can utilize the newly acquired blood sugar for energy. Diabetics, however, are unable to produce insulin or cannot utilize it effectively, leading to major health problems. Unfortunately, many people suffer from this health problem.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The risk of developing diabetes increases with age (DECODE-DECODA Study Group & International Diabetes Epidemiology Group, 2003; Mordarska & Godziejewska-Zawada, 2017) due to changes in the human body such as altered metabolism and insulin sensitivity. Higher BMI is often linked with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes (Abdullah et al., 2010; DECODE-DECODA Study Group & International Diabetes Epidemiology Group, 2003), as excess body fat can affect insulin resistance. Blood glucose level is also direct indicator of diabetes. Elevated levels may suggest problems with insulin use or production in the body. The explanation for each predictor highlights their major role in determining whether an individual has diabetes. Therefore, this project aims to answer the question: can diabetes in an individual be predicted accurately using their age, body mass index (BMI), and blood glucose level?  \n",
    "\n",
    "The diabetes prediction data set contains medical information about patients' diabetes status (positive or negative) and other pertinent health information. There are 9 columns (containing categorical and numerical data): age, gender, BMI, hypertension, heart disease, smoking history, HbA1c level, blood glucose level, and diabetes status. In total, there are 100,000 participants and thus 100,000 rows available. "

    "A KNN classifier model was created to predict patients as diabetic or non-diabetic using BMI, age, and glucose levels as predictors. After performing various codes and testing k values ranging from 1 to 100, the optimal k value (that maximized accuracy) was found to be 46. Next, a workflow using this k value was created and trained on the downsampled training dataset. To assess how well the model predicts diabetes cases, a confusion matrix was generated to compute performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. The following was found:  \n",
    "\n",
    "Accuracy - 79%, Precision - 28%, Recall - 86%.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Since we built a classifier to predict diabetes status where it is ‘non-diabetic’ 91% of the time, an accuracy of 79% is not sufficient (it just mainly guesses ‘non-diabetic’). However, it is also important to consider precision and recall.\n",
    "\n",
    "The low precision of the model (28%) can be observed in Figures 5 to 10. As demonstrated by these figures, the model tends to make a large number of false positive predictions, classifying data points near the existing clusters of diabetic data points as diabetic when they are in fact non-diabetic. In effect, it overestimates the size of the regions which should be classified as diabetic. This is likely due to the fact that the non-diabetic data points in the training data were downsampled such that there was an equal proportion of both outcomes, resulting in diabetic data points further from the cluster having a disproportionate impact on the classifier’s predictions. A possible method of mitigating this may be to retain more of the non-diabetic data points in the training set such that the ratio of non-diabetic to diabetic points is greater than 1:1. This may decrease the number of false positives by reducing the effect of outlier diabetic data points on predictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although a low precision is not ideal, being falsely diagnosed as diabetic likely will not have significantly negative effects on a person's health. In contrast, a high recall is much more important, as those with diabetes need to be identified and treated as soon as possible. A recall of 86% seems relatively good, but considering our classification problem type, it is not very impressive. A significant number of cases are still being classified as false negatives. This has serious consequences as diabetics must identify their illness in a timely manner to receive proper treatment.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In accordance with the histograms/scatterplots generated, BMI was found to be a weak predictor of diabetes (no relationship), while age and glucose levels showed a positive correlation with diabetes. \n",

    "Although we were able to predict patients' diabetes status with some certainty, we expected to have a much higher accuracy. However, our results make sense after reflection on our coding methods. We could only run a cross-validation of 5 due to computational power limitations. If we could have chosen 10 instead, our accuracy estimate may have been better with a lower standard error. This would have led us to potentially find a new k value. Additionally, BMI was not a good predictor of diabetes, leaving us only two good predictors: Age and glucose levels. Having three strong predictors is ideal and could have led to more accurate results. \n"

    "The findings from this study have the potential to significantly influence various aspects of healthcare and individual wellness. Firstly, they can improve screening and early diagnosis. By accurately identifying individuals at a higher risk of diabetes based on age, BMI, and blood glucose levels, healthcare systems can implement targeted screening strategies. Early diagnosis enables timely interventions, which may slow the progression of diabetes and reduce associated complications. Additionally, these insights allow physicians to offer personalized treatment approaches. Understanding how these key variables correlate with diabetes risk aids in the development of tailored treatment plans, enhancing their effectiveness and improving patient outcomes. Furthermore, the research informs preventive healthcare measures. High-risk individuals, for instance, can receive counseling on lifestyle modifications such as diet and exercise to mitigate their risk or delay the onset of diabetes.  \n",

    "\n",
    "Building on the first study's identification of age, BMI, and blood glucose levels as diabetes predictors, further investigations might examine the interactions between genetic predispositions and these variables, evaluating how they jointly affect the likelihood of developing diabetes. Deeper understanding of these metrics' dynamic link with the course of diabetes might be possible by a longitudinal research tracking changes in these metrics over time. It is also critical to investigate more how various demographics, such as socioeconomic position and ethnicity, impact the prediction power of these factors. Furthermore, the integration of cutting-edge technology such as artificial intelligence (AI) and continuous glucose monitoring has the potential to transform diabetes management and early diagnosis, resulting in customized treatment regimens and preventive measures. This has the potential to improve patient care both individually and inform national health policies that eventually aim to lower the worldwide burden of diabetes.\n"
